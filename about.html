                <h2>Hell0!</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Javier Flores-Rendon, and I’m an aspiring software engineer with a long-standing
                    passion for building things that live on the internet. My journey into coding began with
                    curiosity and has grown into a dedicated pursuit of mastering software development.
                    I’ve always had a strong affinity for technology—ever since I was a kid spending hours
                    playing video games. That curiosity naturally led me to wonder how games were built,
                    and from there, my interest in development continued to grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe strongly in learning by doing. Every project I build teaches me something new,
                    and every bug I fix helps me become a better developer. While my experience in coding is
                    still in its early stages, I’m committed to continuously expanding my understanding of
                    computer science fundamentals and growing into a well-rounded engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading documentation,
                    and contributing to open-source projects. I also enjoy hands-on work like building arcade
                    machines and learning about different operating systems such as macOS, Linux, and
                    Raspberry Pi environments, and more. My current goal is to land an entry-level software 
                    engineering position where I can continue learning and contribute to meaningful, real-world projects.
